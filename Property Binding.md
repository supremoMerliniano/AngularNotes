Property binding in Angular allows you to set properties of HTML elements or directives based on values from your component. It's a one-way data binding mechanism, meaning data flows from the component to the template.

You use square brackets `[]` to bind a property in the template to a property of the component.

**Example:**

1. **Component File (app.component.ts)**:
	```typescript
		import { Component } from '@angular/core';
		
		@Component({
		  selector: 'app-root',
		  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
		  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
		})
		export class AppComponent {
		  isButtonDisabled: boolean = true;
		  imageUrl: string = 'https://example.com/image.jpg';
		
		  toggleButtonActivation() {
		    this.isButtonDisabled = !this.isButtonDisabled;
		  }
		}
	```

2. **HTML Template File (app.component.html)**:

```html
<div>
  <img [src]="imageUrl" alt="Sample Image">
  <button [disabled]="isButtonDisabled">Click me</button>
  <button (click)="toggleButtonActivation()">Toggle Button</button>
</div>
```

## When to use it

- When you want to set properties of HTML elements or directives dynamically based on values from your component.
- When you want to pass data from a component to its child components.

Property binding is especially useful for scenarios like:

- Disabling or enabling buttons based on certain conditions.
- Dynamically setting attributes like `src` for images or `href` for links.

Remember, property binding is one-way, meaning changes in the component will be reflected in the template, but not the other way around. If you need two-way data binding (changes in the template affecting the component), you would use a combination of property binding and event binding.
