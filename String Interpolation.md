**String interpolation** in Angular is a way to dynamically embed expressions within template literals or strings. It allows you to display data from your component's properties in your HTML templates.

You use string interpolation with double curly braces `{{ }}` to bind expressions. These expressions are evaluated and their results are converted to strings and inserted into the HTML template.

**Example:**

1. **Component File (app.component.ts)**:

```typescript
	import { Component } from '@angular/core';
	@Component({
	  selector: 'app-root',
	  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
	  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
	})
	export class AppComponent {
	  greetingMessage: string = 'Hello, World!';
	  user: string = 'John Doe';
	}
```

2. **HTML Template File (app.component.html)**:

```html
	<div>
	  <h1>{{ greetingMessage }}</h1>
	  <p>Welcome, {{ user }}!</p>
	</div>
```

## When to use String Interpolation

String interpolation is used when you want to display dynamic data in your templates. This is particularly useful for displaying things like:

- Component properties.
- The result of calculations or method calls.
- Data fetched from an API.

It's important to note that string interpolation can only be used for one-way data binding. If you want to create interactive components where data can be updated and synchronized in both directions (from component to template and from template to component), you'll need to use other techniques like property binding or two-way data binding.

## Important note

Always be cautious when interpolating user-provided data to avoid potential security vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Angular provides built-in mechanisms to handle these cases, such as sanitization, but it's important to be aware of potential risks. Always sanitize or escape user-generated content before displaying it in your templates.
